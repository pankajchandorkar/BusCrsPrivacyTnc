            <p>To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide MAVENTECH
                Offerings, we use cookies. </p>

            <h2 class="heading2">How We Share Personal Information</h2>

            <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the
                business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share personal information
                only as described below and with MAVENTECH LABS PRIVATE LIMITED, and the affiliates
                that MAVENTECH LABS PRIVATE LIMITED, controls that are either subject to this Privacy
                Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Transactions Involving Third Parties:</b> We make available to you services, software,
                    and content provided by third parties for use on or through MAVENTECH Offerings.
                    You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share information
                    related to those transactions with that third party. For example, you can order services,
                    software, and content from sellers using the MAVENTECH and we provide those sellers
                    information to facilitate your subscription, purchases, or support.</li>
                <li><b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> We employ other companies and individuals to perform
                    functions on our behalf. Examples include: delivering MAVENTECH hardware, sending
                    communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analysing
                    data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event
                    management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training.
                    These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to
                    perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process
                    that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
                    data protection law.</li>
                <li><b>Business Transfers:</b> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
                    businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the
                    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing
                    Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the
                    unlikely event that MAVENTECH or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your
                    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
                </li>
                <li><b>Protection of Us and Others:</b> We release account and other personal information when
                    we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and
                    other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of MAVENTECH, our
                    customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
                    organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.</li>
                <li><b>At Your Option:</b> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
                    information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an
                    opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2 class="heading2">Location of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>MAVENTECH is located in the INDIA, and our affiliated companies are located throughout the
                world. Depending on the scope of your interactions with MAVENTECH Offerings, your personal
                information may be stored in or accessed from multiple countries, including the India. Whenever
